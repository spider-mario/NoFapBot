 NoFapBot
==========

This is an IRC bot that aims at helping people measure their NoFap_ streaks.

Requirements
=============

The bot is written in Groovy_, so you need a Groovy interpreter to run it. It
has been tested with GroovyÂ 2.4, so at least this version should work.

The very first time that it is run, it also requires an Internet connection to
download its dependencies from `Maven Central`_ (unless you happen to have
another way to make them available to `the Grape dependency manager`_).

.. _the Grape dependency manager: http://docs.groovy-lang.org/2.4.5/html/documentation/grape.html

Configuration files
====================

To know what servers to connect to, the bot uses YAML_ configuration files. You
can use the provided example, ``freenode.cfg``, as a starting point for your own
configuration files.
